This endocrinologist has been my primary specialist since I was first diagnosed with hypothyroidism, and they were the first one to catch when I unexpectedly developed hyperparathyroidism. In fact, they called me on a weekend while they were out of the state on a trip with their spouse because of the criticality of the lab results and were quick to set me up with a professional surgeon (my surgeon taught students how to perform parathyroidectomies at a major university). They always go the extra mile for their patients and have seen my family for a long time; as such, I am very scared to lose them as a provider because it is always challenging to find a provider who truly cares for their patients.\\xa0\\n\\nFor a little more context, I am a 22 y/o college student who is transferring out of my home state of Illinois to pursue my BS in Texas. I am a resident of Illinois with BCBS of Illinois for insurance, however, I have established care with some doctors in Texas. I had hoped to continue seeing my endocrinologist (who is located in IL) via telehealth but with the change in Texas law, the fact that I am only going to be in Texas for college, their lack of a Texas medical license, my status as an Illinois resident, and the fact that my insurance is based in IL, we were not sure if doing so would even be legal. She does not typically see individuals who are college-aged and so this is a new circumstance that she has not had before, thus everyone is confused on what is/is not allowed at the moment. With all this in mind, I wanted to come here and ask - would it be legal for me to continue seeing my Illinois endocrinologist while I am in Texas for college via Telehealth/Telemedicine services? I do plan to call my insurance and ask this as well, but I also thought asking this here might not be a bad idea as there may be specific details/laws/regulations you all may know that the agent I speak to does not.
